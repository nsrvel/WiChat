# AGENTS.md — WiChat

Guidance for humans and coding agents working in this repository.

## Product

WiChat is a **self-hosted**, **AGPL-3.0** team communication platform with a **plugin architecture** — a **major product** built for real daily use. Operability, security, and deployability are part of the application, not optional polish.

**Canonical spec:** [docs/architecture/wichat-system-design.md](docs/architecture/wichat-system-design.md)

## Architecture constraints (do not drift)

- Core backend: **Go monorepo microservices** under `backend/services/` (gRPC + Kafka between services).
- Separate processes: **LiveKit**, **plugins (gRPC)**, not core domains.
- Data: PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch, MinIO, Kafka.
- Clients: Next.js (web + iOS PWA), Electron, React Native (Android).
- **Non-goals:** multi-tenant public SaaS, federation, E2E encryption v1, public plugin marketplace v1.

## Repository layout (target)

```
backend/       # Go: services/, pkg/, plugins/ (plugin servers)
frontend/      # web-client (Next.js)
deploy/        # docker compose, env templates
docs/          # architecture & ops
```

Monorepo boundaries: [docs/architecture/monorepo-layout.md](docs/architecture/monorepo-layout.md).

Phases in system design §15 — implement in order unless explicitly reprioritized.

## Quality bar (production-ready)

- Security: TLS, rate limits, no secrets in repo, bcrypt/argon2, guest/session scoping per spec.
- Tests: Go unit (~90% goal on core), testcontainers for integration, Playwright for critical E2E paths.
- Observability: Grafana + Loki (when services exist).
- API: REST `/api/v1/`, WebSocket for realtime; UTC timestamps; i18n keys from backend.
- Keep core **light** — heavy features belong in plugins.

## Cursor rules

**Always-on:** program + core. **File-scoped:** Go and web when touching those paths.

| Rule | Scope |
|------|--------|
| `wichat-program.mdc` | How we work: `release`, micro-steps, vertical slices |
| `wichat-core.mdc` | Product + architecture guardrails |
| `wichat-go.mdc` | Go backend: tests under `<pkg>/test/`, per-module `make check`, wi-shared patterns |
| `wichat-go-layers.mdc` | Go backend: repository / service / delivery layout |
| `wichat-go-style.mdc` | Go backend: `//` step comments, wiring spacing |
| `wichat-web-layout.mdc` | `frontend/web-client/**` — app vs features, components, no micro-FE |
| `wichat-web-data.mdc` | `frontend/web-client/**` — api-client, Zod, TanStack Query services, WS vs Query |

**Skill:** `.cursor/skills/wichat-web-client/` — scaffold and feature slices for web-client.
